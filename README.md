# seranking-js-lib

Seranking api client

Take atention that i use external config file for email & password import. Edit as needed.
In some calls i reduce responses to only what i needed while building this, do whatever needed by your situation.

I know it's not full lib, It's not my target with this repo for now. I haven't found *any* lib out there and wrote these functions. It might save you some time.

cheers.

P.s. you can hire me to integrate Seranking to your system, I have experience doing it!
